Creating new Project which is not connected to github or not a git repository

git init - it will create an empty git repository

and if any changes in file or modification write a same command like above
:: git add . , git status , git commit -m "commit message here"


but we cannot push this empty repository 

git remote add origin https://github.com/ManojNadar/git-practice-2.git
git branch -- it will show you the branch name ex. main,master

git branch -M main   - it will change the branch name master to main
and now we can push the file into repository 


******************************************************************************************

git branch -a   -- it will show you how many branches you have in the repository


if the repository has more than one branch 
git pull ---- so that you can access the the branch
